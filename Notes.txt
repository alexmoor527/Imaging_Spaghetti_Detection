Issues during pre-proecssing:
usually low quality images -> sharpen
this is expected and intended as an application of this project would most likely use cheap webcams to monitor 3d printers.
blurry images are also ok and intended as depending on the printer type, the print is moving

different image size -> also expected and somewhat intended, same reason as above.

background: print-beds sometimes have 5x5 cm grid with white lines. often detected when using edge detection
            print-beds sometimes have patterns, often getting labeled as spaghetti

filament color: 3d printer filament comes in all colors and sometimes even with glitter. often hard to distinguis from background
                black filament on a black background, white filament with white grid lines
